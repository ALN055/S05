                Superstring Dimension is an Abyss-variant gamemode that was added in Version 4.2. 
                It is currently accessible only by players with Lv. 81 or above.
            </p>

            Superstring Dimension's cycle has 4 stages: Fringe (left), Intensive (top), Perilous (right) 
            and Singular (bottom). Players will start challenging Fringe in order to get access to Intensive 
            and Singular. Successfully completing the former will unlock Perilous, which is basically a boss stage.
        </p>
    </section>

        <p>
            Fringe, Intensive and Perilous may have same weather, while Singular has different one from the rest. 
            All four may also have different effects to each other.
        </p>

        <p>
            Completing Fringe, Intensive and Singular will rewards 6000 points each, and Perilous will give 3000 + 
            remaining points, which will be based on how long they take to succeed.

            <p>
                Unlike other Abyss-variants, Superstring Dimension introduces Trophies mechanic which, depends on 
                player's place during cycle's finalization, will be either increased or decreased. The change of 
                remaining trophies will promote them to higher rank if they have high enough trophies, or vice versa. 
                In other words, players will not be promoted or relegated directly.
            </p>

        <section>
            <p>
                Once entering the mode for the first time, player will also start with 180 Virtual Trophies 
                (which can be increased by 100 if promoted to Red Lotus once), which will be reduced instead 
                of the actual trophies in case of their rank is low during finalization.

            <p>
                Memorial Arena, as its name implies, is a game mode where Captains can face off against challenging 
                bosses from previous encounters. The virtual battlefield uses data to recreate enemies and have them 
                battle with Valkyries with the aim of increasing Valkyries' battle prowess. Memorial Arena runs from 
                Tuesday, 04:00 to Monday, 02:00 every week. Between Monday 02:00 and Tuesday 04:00, results are 
                calculated and rewards are distributed.
            </p>

                <h4> - Battling Enemies </h4>
            </header>
            <p>
                Enemies in the Memorial Arena have their memory upgraded with ranks "C, B, A, S, SS" with each 
                letter corresponding to a different difficulty level. Once a Captain has defeated an enemy at a 
                certain difficulty level, they will automatically move up to the next difficulty level. After 
                certain difficulty levels, enemies in the arena will begin to use different attacks and 
                sometimes even special ultimate skills when damaged enough.
                <br /> <br />
                The Exalted bracket also features 2 SSS rank Bosses (as of Patch v6.1, including 20% UP one, and 
                one at the middle) which the captain can challenge to get bonus score-based rewards. In addition, 
                there's also Buffed Mode that can be enabled before the encounter. That will overall benefit their 
                team during the battle, in exchange for the score loss at the end of the fight.

                </header>
                <P>
                    Once a valkyrie or a gear is used for a Memorial Arena boss, the valkyrie or gear is locked to 
                    that boss. In addition, unawaken and awaken forms of the same valkyrie cannot be used for the 
                    same boss -- even if they are used in different attempts. The lock is finalized when an attempt is 
                    registered -- ie. by either defeating a boss or being defeated without exiting early.
                </P>

                        - Brackets
                    </h4>
                </header>
                Captains are placed into 4 different brackets based on their captain level.
                <ul>
                    <li>Basic (Lv.38-55): 2 bosses; 4 attempts per day.</li>
                    <li>Elites (Lv.56~69): 2 bosses; 4 attempts per day.</li>
                    <li>Masters (Lv.70-80): 3 bosses; 5 attempts per day.</li>
                    <li>Exalted (Lv.81-88): 3 bosses; 6 attempts per day.</li>
                </ul>
                If a Captain levels up during a rotation, they will not move up in bracket until the next rotation.
                The difficulty of the bosses increase significantly as a captain moves up in brackets. 
                For example, a Rank S boss may pose a significant challenge for a level 70 captain in Masters even 
                though the captain can achieve good scores with same boss at Rank SS previously in Elites. The 
                additional 3rd boss may be out of reach due the sudden requirement for a 3rd team of valkyries 
                along with their gears. Memorial Arena is thus one of the reasons that it is advisable to slow down 
                leveling above level 50 or level 60 -- depending on active events of the time.

                    <h4>
                        - Scoring
                    </h4>
                </header>
                <p>
                    The maximum score for each boss goes up as a captain beats a higher rank of that boss. 
                    The actual score is reduced by the amount of in-game arena time the captain spends beating the 
                    boss of that rank (Time spent on previous rank are not counted). At SS rank, every in-game second 
                    spent equates to 53-point reduction, and each SS rank boss allows for a maximum score of 31946 which 
                    equivalent to defeating them with 0-second wasted. Captains can challenge the same boss again at SS 
                    or SSS (Exalted only) rank. Only the highest score achieved will be counted.
                    <br /><br />
                    Each rotation there is also one boss that gives a bonus 20% to the score achieved against it.
                    <br /><br />
                    During a boss encounter, if a captain is defeated either by losing all valkyries or by timer running 
                    out, the captain will lose a challenge attempt. A score based on the remaining health of the boss and 
                    its rank will be awarded -- although much less than the score from defeating the boss. If the captain 
                    abandons during an encounter, no score is awarded but no challenge attempt is consumed either.

        <section>
            <p>
                Elysian Realm is similar to Threshold Breach, you solo the entire stage with one combat Valkyrie and 
                two support Valkyries that have special skills to aid you in battle. The only difference is that you 
                use your own Valkyrie, and not a trial Valkyrie.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4> - Gameplay</h4>
            <p>
                There are 4 difficulties: Safe, Normal, Dangerous, and Real. Safe has 8 floors, Normal has 12 floors, 
                Dangerous has 16 floors, and Real also has 16 floors. Clearing Safe, Normal, or Dangerous with each 
                combat Valkyrie for the first time gives 100 crystals. For example, clearing Safe for the first time 
                with HoR and clearing Safe for the first time with SN both give separate first time clearing rewards, 
                so you would get 200 crystals in this example. To unlock a difficulty you need to complete all floors 
                of the one before it. For example, to unlock Normal, you need to clear all of Sequence: Safe.
                <br /><br />
                You can adjust the difficulty level when you play Real by selecting different handicaps. 
                The higher the difficulty the more rewards. The starting difficulty is 30. You can unlock 
                more handicaps after clearing Real at higher difficulties.

            <h4> - Signets/Buffs</h4>
            <p>
                After clearing a floor, you will get a Signet. Each member of Fire Moth has their own Signets that gives
                 unique buffs. Fire Moth members are also referred to as Flame-Chaser. The **t floor always gives 
                 Elysia's Signet and after that you choose from 2 or 3 portals at the end of the stage for which 
                 buffs you want. Each portal has a symbol which indicates which Signets you can obtain from there.
